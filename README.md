# javascript30-day8
>  I developed the "day8" project on the [javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) site with a design of my own.
>> While writing the javascript code, I have benefited significantly from the [javascript30 github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/08%20-%20Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas) source.
